  Mi Goreng or Mie Goreng is a Indonesian, Malaysian, <br>Bruneian, and Singaporean thin yellow noodles dish fried <br> in cooking oil with garlic, onion or shallots, fried prawn, <br> chicken, beef, or sliced meat balls, chili, Chinese cabbage,<br> tomatoes, egg and other vegetables. <br>
  <br>
  I remember when I first tried Mi Goreng when my family <br>migrated to Malaysia 10 years ago. Ubiquitous in Malaysia, <br>it is almost found everywhere in the country, sold by all <br>food vendors from street-hawkers, to high-end restaurants. <br>Mi Goreng is the first Malaysian dish I had in my life and <br>it has become one of my favorite dishes. <br>
  <br>
  There are other versions of Mi Goreng with slightly different <br> ingredients such as types of protein and noodles. My favorite <br> Mi Goreng is Bihun Goreng Ayam, which literally means fried <br> rice vermicelli with chicken. I love to add chili paste to my <br> noodles for a tinge of spiciness as Mi Goreng sometimes <br> can be too greasy.

  Bring a pan of water to a boil, and cook the ramen until tender, <br>
  about 3 minutes. Plunge the noodles into cold water to stop <br>
