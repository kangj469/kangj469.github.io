    Soju is an alcohol from Korea that most often comes in a green bottle. Its alcohol content ranges from 16.8 percent to 53 percent, and it's made from ingredients like rice, wheat, or sweet potatoes. Neat and unadorned is the traditional route for Korean drinking of this product, but it can also easily be made into fun fruit cocktails. This is strawberry sprite soju. Just mix soju, strawberry juice and sprite in equal amounts. You can have just a shot, but this combination is sure to be so tasty you might as well make a glass!
