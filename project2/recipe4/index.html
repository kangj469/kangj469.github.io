<div class="title"> Mi Goreng </div>

<div class="explain">
  Mi Goreng or Mie Goreng is an Indonesian, Malaysian, Bruneian, and Singaporean thin yellow noodles dish fried in cooking oil with garlic, onion or shallots, fried prawn, chicken, beef, or sliced meat balls, chili, Chinese cabbage, tomatoes, egg and other vegetables. 
  <br>
  <br>
  I remember when I first tried Mi Goreng when my family migrated to Malaysia 10 years ago. Ubiquitous in Malaysia, it is almost found everywhere in the country, sold by all food vendors from street-hawkers, to high-end restaurants. Mi Goreng is the first Malaysian dish I had in my life and it has become one of my favorite dishes. 
  <br>
  <br>
  There are other versions of Mi Goreng with slightly different ingredients such as types of protein and noodles. My favorite Mi Goreng is Bihun Goreng Ayam, which literally means fried rice vermicelli with chicken. I love to add chili paste to my noodles for a tinge of spiciness as Mi Goreng sometimes can be too greasy.
