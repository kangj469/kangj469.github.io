  <span class="getoverhere">Get over here and see if you can get this toolbox off me!</span>

  <span class="comeon">Oh, come on Buzz. I can't do this without you.
  <br>
  I need your help.</span>

  <span class="icant">I can't. I can't help anyone.</span>

  <span class="whysure">Why, sure you can Buzz.<br>
  You can get me out oh here<br>
  and then I'll get that rocket off<br>
  you, and we'll make a break for<br>
  Andy's house.</span>

<div class="woody">
  Buzz, you've had a big fall. 
  You must not be thinking clearly!
</div>

<div class="buzz">
  No, Woody.
  For the first time, I AM thinking clearly.
  You were right all along
  I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy.
  A STUPID, LIITLE, INSIGNIFICANT TOY.
</div>

<div class="woody">
  Whoa, hey.
  Wait a minute.
  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
</div>

<div class="buzz">
  Yeah, right.
</div>

<div class="woody">
  No, it is!
  Look, over there in that house is a kid
  who thinks you are the greatest and 
  it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal.
  It's because you're his toy. YOU ARE HIS TOY!
</div>

<div class="buzz">
  But why would Andy want me?
</div>

<div class="woody">
  Why would Andy want you? Look at you!
  You're a Buzz Lightyear!
  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.
  You've got wings,
  you glow in the dark,
  you talk, 
  your helmet does that... that whoosh thing.
  You're a cool toy.
  As a matter of fact, you're too cool.
  I mean - what chance does a toy like me
  have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure.
  All I can do it this:
<br>
  <span class="voice">THERE'S A SNAKE IN MY BOOT!</span>
<br>
  Why would Andy ever wanna play with me,
  when he's got you?
  I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket...
